# Practice JavaScript First Class Functions

A set of three exercises in JavaScript to practice writing first class functions.
Exercises are numbered from 0 to 2 and are all relatively easier but illustrate an evolution of technique.
Each exercise is structured as a unit test suite with one or more tests, which must all pass in order to complete the exercise.
You must use first class functions to solve the problems. Further instructions can be found in each exercise.

## Instructions

1. Run `npm i` to install the dependencies (just `jest` and an optional library for creating PNG files)
2. Run `npm run test` or `npm start` to run the unit tests. They will all fail to start with.
3. Make 'em pass!

## The exercises

0. [A calculator which takes binary operators and operands](https://github.com/undevelopercoach/practice-js-first-class-functions/blob/main/exercises/0-calculator-binary.test.js)
1. [Converting the calculator to take curried operators](https://github.com/undevelopercoach/practice-js-first-class-functions/blob/main/exercises/1-calculator-curried.test.js)
2. [Writing some new unary operators for our calculator](https://github.com/undevelopercoach/practice-js-first-class-functions/blob/main/exercises/2-calculator-unary.test.js)

## Disclaimer

This project is intended purely as a means to practice writing recursion for various contrived examples. The use of recursion may not actually be the best way to solve these problems "in real life"; nor are these exercises intended in any way to demonstrate "best practice" â€“ they are just for fun!
